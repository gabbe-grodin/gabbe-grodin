### Hi there, I'm Gabbe ðŸ‘‹
By day, I am a professional [Artist](https://gabbegrodin.com) and [Art Teacher](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkGj4LKu6rB/).

By night, I study web development.

I created my [first website](https://web.archive.org/web/20150417161244/http://gabbegrodin.com/index.html) in 2006 and became hooked on building for the web.

I'm currently being trained as a full stack Python Web Developer. I build with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, mySQL, Bootstrap and Tailwind.
