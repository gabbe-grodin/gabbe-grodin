### Hi there, I'm Gabbe ðŸ‘‹
By day, I am a professional [Artist](https://gabbegrodin.com) and [Art Teacher](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkGj4LKu6rB/).

By night, I study web development.

I created [my first website in 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20150417161244/http://gabbegrodin.com/index.html) and became hooked on building for the web.

My city recently paid a training agency to make me a full stack Python Web Developer (I LOVE YOU, San Antonio!). I build with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, mySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Figma and more.
